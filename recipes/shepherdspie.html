        <ul><h4>Potato Topping:</h4>
            <li>1 ½ - 2 lb. russet potatoes -about 2 large potatoes peeled and cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
            <li>8 tablespoons unsalted butter -1 stick</li>

            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>


      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol><h4>Make the Meat Filling.</h4>
        <li>Add the oil to a large skillet and place it over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add the onions. Cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li><br>
        <li>Add the ground beef (or ground lamb) to the skillet and break it apart with a wooden spoon. Add the parsley, rosemary, thyme, salt, and and pepper. Stir well. Cook for 6-8 minutes, until the meat is browned, stirring occasionally.</li><br>
        <li>Add the Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute.</li><br>
        <li>Add the flour and tomato paste. Stir until well incorporated and no clumps of tomato paste remain.</li><br>
        <li>Add the broth, frozen peas and carrots, and frozen corn. Bring the liquid to a boil then reduce to simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li><br>
        <li>Set the meat mixture aside. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li><br>
      </ol>

      <ol><h4>Make the Potato Topping</h4>
        <li>Place the potatoes in a large pot. Cover the potatoes with water. Bring the water to a boil. Reduce to a simmer. Cook until potatoes are fork tender, 10-15 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Drain the potatoes in a colander. Return the potatoes to the hot pot. Let the potatoes rest in the hot pot for 1 minute to evaporate any remaining liquid.</li><br>
        <li>Add butter, half & half, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mash the potatoes and stir until all the ingredients are mixed together.</li><br>
        <li>Add the parmesan cheese to the potatoes. Stir until well combined.</li><br>
      </ol>

      <ol><h4>Assemble the Casserole</h4>
        <li>Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.</li><br>
        <li>Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.</li><br>
